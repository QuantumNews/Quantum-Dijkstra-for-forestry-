# Quantum-Dijkstra-for-forestry-
his project leverages quantum computing to enhance forestry management in British Columbia, Canada. By integrating Grover's algorithm into the Dijkstra pathfinding algorithm, we aim to optimize supply chains, reduce costs, and improve decision-making in post-fire salvage and bioenergy utilization, contributing to sustainable forestry practices.
